            <h2>Personal</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Jake Malwitz, professional student, health aficionado, and
               aspiring computer programmer. Originally from Lake Elmo, Minnesota,
               in the summer of 2015 I graduated from Augsburg College with a 
               Bachelor's Degree in Economics with a minor in Computer Science. 
               After graduation I decided to apply to Prime Digital Academy in 
               Bloomington, MN, where I'm constantly improving my programming 
               skills and learning new topics every day. Upon graduation, I 
               hope to hone the skills I've learned at Prime to develop 
               convenient health and fitness related applications for those 
               looking to lead and live healthier lives.
            </p>
